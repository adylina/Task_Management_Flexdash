# Task_Management_Flexdash
A flexdashboard for task management using googlesheets4


## Overview

I have a strong tendency to want to colourcode everything in my life and manage tasks using a tool that allows me to see things I've done as well as things I have left to do. 

Unlike the Bookish Flexdash that I've previously uploaded, this one does need a bit more work since it's very much arranged for my own life and I don't think that's particularly generalisable. 

## Instructions to set your google sheet task list

Column headers for your google sheet should be as follows:

1. Life_Area (highest level classification level for your tasks)

2. Work_Area (second level of classification level for your tasks)

3. Project (lowest classiciation level)

4. Task (the actual thing you need to do)

5. Due_Date	(I have this set as a Day-Month, but nothing is graphed, so whatever works for you is fine)

6. Deliverable_To	(To whom are you accountable for your task?)

7. Complete	(Yes/No)

8. Complete_Date	(Again, no graphing, so format for dates is flexible and I don't mess about with lubridate)

9. Notes (What else do you need to know about the task? Are there files to reference? Did the deliverable hand-off go off well?)
